# Content System Design Document

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture and design for a generic content management system that supports multi-backend storage, versioning, preview generation, lifecycle events, and audit trails. The system is designed to be flexible, extensible, and integration-friendly with external systems handling access control (ACL).

## Objectives
- Store and manage content with metadata.
- Support storing content across multiple storage backends.
- Enable versioning of content objects.
- Allow preview generation for supported content types.
- Emit lifecycle events for system observability and async processing.
- Track audit trails for create, update, and access actions.
- Delegate access control (ACL) to external systems.

## Core Concepts

### Content
- Identified by an externally supplied `content_id` (UUID).
- Can have multiple versions.
- Each version can be stored in one or more storage backends.

### Object
- Represents the actual binary stored in a storage backend.
- One content version may have multiple associated objects (across backends).

### Metadata
- **Content Metadata**: General attributes (e.g., source system, filename).
- **Object Metadata**: Backend-specific or technical attributes (e.g., content type, checksum).

### Preview
- Previews are generated asynchronously for supported types.
- Multiple types of previews are supported (image thumbnail, PDF render, etc.).

### Audit Trail
- Captures create, update, access events.
- Stores actor identity, timestamp, and optional metadata.

### Lifecycle Events
- Published on a message bus (e.g., Kafka, NATS, or SQS).
- Used to trigger preview generation, cleanup, notifications, etc.
